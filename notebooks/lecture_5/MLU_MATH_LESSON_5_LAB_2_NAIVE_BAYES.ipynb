For Bayes Theorem to succed computing this conditional probability, especially when each data input variable is dependent on all other variables, a large number of observed data samples are needed to figure out reliable probabilities distributions for all different possible combinations of variables involved. Even when such large datasets are available, (as we remarked during the lecture) Bayes Theorem itself is computationally expensive. \n",

In particular, the MultinomialNB that implements the Naive Bayes algorithm for multinomially distributed data, worked best on training and test. Keep in mind that this is a synthetic dataset, and again we focus here on the techniques itself, and not on performance. However, this also gives us the opportunity to comment on the relevance and importance of Naive Bayes as yet another tool in the classifier's toolkit. \n",

They require a small amount of training data to estimate the necessary parameters, and can therefore be extremely fast compared to more sophisticated methods. For example, a comparison of logistic regression and Naive Bayes, can be found [here](https://ai.stanford.edu/~ang/papers/nips01-discriminativegenerative.pdf).\n",
