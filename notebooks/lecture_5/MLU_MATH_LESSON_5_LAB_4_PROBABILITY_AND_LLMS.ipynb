We will use the [GPT-2 model](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/gpt2) as our \"toy model\" to illustrate these concepts. GPT-2, developed by OpenAI, is a generative pre-trained transformer model that can generate coherent and contextually relevant text given an initial prompt.\n",
