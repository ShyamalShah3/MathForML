Either data collected in a `.csv` file, or text, images, sounds... before being used to train the machine model of choice, all data needs to be preprocessed and somehow transformed into numerical values. This process is called **data vectorization**. These numerical values are organized into mathematical structures of *vectors* and *matrices* (and more generally, *tensors*), that  can be mathematically manipulated, just like scalars. \n",
