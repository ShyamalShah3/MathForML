    "\n",

    "\n",

    "If we know how to estimate $P(B\\mid A)$, $P(A)$, and $P(B)$,\n",
    "then we can estimate $P(A\\mid B)$.\n",
    "We often find it easier to estimate one term directly\n",
    "but not the other and Bayes' theorem can come to the rescue here.\n",
    "For instance, if we know the prevalence of symptoms for a given disease,\n",
    "and the overall prevalences of the disease and symptoms, respectively,\n",
    "we can determine how likely someone is\n",
    "to have the disease based on their symptoms.\n",
    "In some cases we might not have direct access to $P(B)$,\n",
    "such as the prevalence of symptoms.\n",
    "In this case a simplified version of Bayes' theorem comes in handy:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(A \\mid B) \\propto P(B \\mid A) P(A).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we know that $P(A \\mid B)$ must be normalized to $1$, i.e., $\\sum_a P(A=a \\mid B) = 1$,\n",
    "we can use it to compute\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(A \\mid B) = \\frac{P(B \\mid A) P(A)}{\\sum_a P(B \\mid A=a) P(A = a)}.$$\n",

    "In Bayesian statistics, we think of an observer\n",
    "as possessing some (subjective) prior beliefs\n",
    "about the plausibility of the available hypotheses\n",
    "encoded in the *prior* $P(H)$,\n",
